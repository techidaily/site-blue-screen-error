### Fix 2: Run SFC

 Sometimes the **HIDCLASS.SYS** issue happens if your system files are corrupt. So you should run SFC (System File Checker), the built-in Windows tool to  scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files if it detects any.

Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and type **cmd** . Then right click on **Command Prompt**   and click **Run as administrator** .

 Click **Yes**   when prompted to confirm.
2. In the command prompt window, type **sfc /scannow**   and press **Enter** .
