 Click the**Check for updates** button on the right side of the pane. If you can see any available updates, download and install them first before you move on.

 One of the causes of this blue screen error could be recent changes you’ve made to your system. If you’ve added new hardware or software to your system recently, remove them to see if the problem is fixed.

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

 Another possible causes of this problem is faulty or outdated device drivers, such as the drivers for your sound card, graphics card, chipset, network adapters, processors and many more.

 You should verify that all your devices have the latest driver, and update those that don’t.
