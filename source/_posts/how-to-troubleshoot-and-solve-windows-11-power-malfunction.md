<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **First Thing First**

 Before we go any further, please make sure that you’ve done the following things:

 1) You’ve installed all available updates and packs on**Windows Update** . You can check by following the path:**Start button > Settings > Updates & security** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/img_589d60756080b.jpg)

 Click the**Check for updates** button on the right side of the pane. If you can see any available updates, download and install them first before you move on.

 2) You have run your antivirus programs and made sure that any possible threats have already been removed from your computer.

 If you have done the above two things, and the problem persists, please move forward to find the solution for you.

## **Step 1** **: Undo recent Changes**

 One of the causes of this blue screen error could be recent changes you’ve made to your system. If you’ve added new hardware or software to your system recently, remove them to see if the problem is fixed.

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

## **Step 2: Update Available Device Drivers**

 Another possible causes of this problem is faulty or outdated device drivers, such as the drivers for your sound card, graphics card, chipset, network adapters, processors and many more.

 You should verify that all your devices have the latest driver, and update those that don’t.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the**Pro version** it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to any flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58ee0474d544c.jpg)

## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 Faulty RAM is a very common reason for a blue screen of death problem such as Bad Pool Caller. You can run the built-in check to see if your RAM is at fault:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mdsched-exe.png)

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/restart-now-and-check-for-problems-recommended.jpg)

 3) When you restart your PC, the check will start as well. It’ll take up to 10 minutes to finish.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/start-button-file-explorer-this-pc.jpg)

 2) Right-click the hard driver you want to check and click **Properties** .
