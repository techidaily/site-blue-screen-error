### Fix 4: Update your BIOS

**BIOS**   (**Basic Input/Output System** ) performs the hardware initialization and jumpstarts the processes during the booting process of your computer. So we can try updating our **BIOS**   to see if it sorts out our CLASSPNP.SYS blue screen issue.

**Important** : Updating BIOS incorrectly might incur loss of data or even more serious problems. So please proceed with caution or seek professional help in the **BIOS updating process** .

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **msinfo32**  into the box and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/img_5b714e5d73e95.png)
2. In **the information** in **BIOS Version/Date**  and go to the manufacturer’s official website.
3. Check out the **Support** (or **Download** ) section and search for the latest BIOS update.
4. Download the file and install it properly.
5. Restart your PC and see if the CLASSPNP.SYS blue screen problem has been resolved. If yes, then great. But if it doesn’t work, don’t worry. There’s one more step for you to try.
