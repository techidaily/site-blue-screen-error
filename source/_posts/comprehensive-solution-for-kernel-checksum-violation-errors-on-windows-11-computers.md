 Then click**Update driver** .  
 Go on to choose**Seach automatically for updated driver software** .

Then Windows will search the update for you automatically.

In such case, let **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  help you. It can find all your missing, outdated and incompatible drivers and offer the correct ones in less than 1 min! And with its Pro version, you can make all your drivers up-to-date in just one-go:**Update All** .
