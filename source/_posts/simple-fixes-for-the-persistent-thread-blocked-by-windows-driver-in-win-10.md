### Fix 4: Update your BIOS

**BIOS**   (**Basic Input/Output System** ) performs the hardware initialization and jumpstarts the processes during the booting process of your computer. So we can try updating our **BIOS**   to see if it sorts out our CLASSPNP.SYS blue screen issue.

**Important** : Updating BIOS incorrectly might incur loss of data or even more serious problems. So please proceed with caution or seek professional help in the **BIOS updating process** .

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **msinfo32**  into the box and press **Enter** .
