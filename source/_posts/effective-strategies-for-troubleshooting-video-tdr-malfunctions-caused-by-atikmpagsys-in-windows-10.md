 2) You have run your antivirus programs and made sure that any possible threats have already been removed from your computer.

 If you have done the above two things, and the problem persists, please move forward to find the solution for you.

## **Step 1** **: Undo recent Changes**

 One of the causes of this blue screen error could be recent changes you’ve made to your system. If you’ve added new hardware or software to your system recently, remove them to see if the problem is fixed.

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

 You should verify that all your devices have the latest driver, and update those that don’t.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 Faulty RAM is a very common reason for a blue screen of death problem such as Bad Pool Caller. You can run the built-in check to see if your RAM is at fault:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/start-button-file-explorer-this-pc.jpg)

 2) Right-click the hard driver you want to check and click **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59aa664b972ec.png)

 3) Go to**Tools** tab and click**Check** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/tools-check.jpg)

 4) If your hard disk drive is problem free, you will see the notification like this:
