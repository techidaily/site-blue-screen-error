### Fix 3: Disable Windows search

1. FOn your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**  into the box and press **Enter** .

### Fix 5: Check disk errors

 Disk check is a useful in-built  Windows tool that scans our hard disk and external drives for errors and fix them.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time. Then right-click on**Local Disk (C:)** and click**Properties** .
