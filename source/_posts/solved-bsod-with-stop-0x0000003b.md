## **1\. Undo recent changes**

 Faulty hardware or fail to install hardware right is closely related to the blue screen of death error 0x00000050\.

 If this is the very first time you had such a problem, and you’ve recently added certain hardware or installed some programs to your computer, they might be the culprit. You may need to remove or uninstall them completely from your PC.
