## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .

 2) Right-click the hard driver you want to check and click **Properties** .

 3) Go to**Tools** tab and click**Check** .
