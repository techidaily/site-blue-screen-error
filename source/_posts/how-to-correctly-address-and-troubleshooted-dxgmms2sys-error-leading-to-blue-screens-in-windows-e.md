So you can update all the available driver on your computer to fix this issue, typically the**video driver** and**network driver** according many users’ report.

 You can update your drivers through Device Manager to let Windows detect and install the update. But you need to verify all your drivers one by one manually.. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2 clicks** (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):
