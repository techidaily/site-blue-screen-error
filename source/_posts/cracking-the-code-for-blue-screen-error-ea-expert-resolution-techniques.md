HYPERVISOR ERROR blue screen of death on Windows

 If your computer freezes occasionally or stops responding, then it shows the above blue screen of death error:**HYPERVISOR ERROR** , don’t worry, you’re not alone. But no need for you to worry much about it, we have gathered here some effective fixes that have helped many other Windows users with the same issue, and you may want to try them as well.

## If you want to know more about hypervisor…

 A hypervisor can be software, firmware, or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs). So it’s also known as a virtual machine monitor, VMM, or virtualize. With it, several virtual machines running on the same host computer can share CPU, memory, storage, and other resources.

 If you want to know more about hypervisors, here’s a post from VMWare with more detailed information: **[What is a hypervisor?](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor.html?resource=cat-2143999149#cat-2143999149)**

 When you see the blue screen of death HYPERVISOR ERROR, which has the bug check value 0x00020001, on your computer, it means that the hypervisor has encountered a fatal error, even though this error code doesn’t specify what the error is exactly.

 There are, however, some general fixes that you can try first to see if they can help to fix the HYPERVISOR ERROR for you. Read on and see how to execute them.

## 1\. Unmake recent changes

 If you’ve recently added any software or hardware to your computer, then the HYPERVISOR ERROR appears, you should try to unmake these changes to your computer.

 For instance, if you’ve just added a new RAM stick to your computer, then you should install this RAM stick on a second device to see if it also causes problems. If so, then the RAM stick should be at fault, and you should talk to the vendor to see what they can do.

 If the HYPERVISOR ERROR happens after you installed certain software, you can do the following to uninstall it, as a test:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control panel** and hit **Enter.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-9.png)
2. View by **Categories,**  then select **Uninstall a program** under **Programs** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-8.png)
3. Click the software recently installed (we use**Steam** as an example here), then **Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-77.png)
4. Restart your computer afterward.

 Then see if the blue screen of death HYPERVISOR ERROR still happens. If so, please move on to the other fixes below.

## 4\. Adjust Hyper-V settings

 The HYPERVISOR ERROR could also happen because of incorrect Hyper-V settings. To see if this is your case:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows** key and **R** key at the same time. Type **control panel** and hit **Enter.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-9.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-6.png)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/image-7.png)

5. Restart your computer if you make changes here.

 Then see if the blue screen of death HYPERVISOR ERROR is still seen. If so, please move further.

---

## 5\. Run the Memory Diagnostic tool

 Some forum users reported that the HYPERVISOR ERROR on their computers was caused by faulty RAM sticks. This is probably because the hypervisor allows virtual machines to use the memory resources of the host computer, and when there are problems with computer memory, a blue screen of death error like HYPERVISOR ERROR appears.

 To see if this is your case, you can run the built-in Memory Diagnostic tool:

1. Press the **Windows logo key** and **R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type **mdsched.exe** , then click **OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-53-32.jpg)
3. Click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** .  

 **IMPORTANT: Make sure to save all your work before restarting.**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_15-53-57.jpg)
4. Windows will run diagnosis automatically, which can take a few minutes. When it’s finished, your PC will reboot.

8. If you see “no errors”, your RAM is functioning well and is not the culprit to the HYPERVISOR ERROR. Then please[**move on to the next method**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_16-00-48.jpg)

 If you do see an error, you may consider replacing your RAM sticks. You will need to check if your device is still under warranty or consult your machine’s manufacturer for assistance if you’re not tech-savvy enough to do this on your own.

## 6\. Run SFC and DISM checks

 Corrupted system files may cause blue screen of death errors as well. But luckily, there are two built-in tools that can help to identify and repair such bad system files. The whole process could take some time, and we suggest you don’t run any other programs when doing the test (If you’re not confident enough to run these commands, you can[**try this automatic tool**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) instead).

To run these tools:

### 6.1 Scan corrupt files with System File Checker

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Checker will then scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

 4) After the scan, run your computer like how you normally would to see if the blue screen error HYPERVISOR ERROR still remains. If so, move on to the next test:

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 6.2 Run dism.exe

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following commands and hit**Enter** after each line:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

2) When the process finishes:

* If the DISM tool gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** , reboot your computer, then open Command Prompt as administrator again (step 1) and run this command line instead:

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 When these tests are done, see if your computer still has the HYPERVISOR ERROR. If the problem still persists, please move on to the next fix.
