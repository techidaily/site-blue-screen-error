### What is _DPC Watchdog Violation_ ?

 The**DPC Watchdog Violation** blue screen of death bug check has a value of **0x00000133** . [ \[1\] ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

**DPC** stands for Deferred Procedure Call. **Watchdog** refers to the bug checker, which usually monitors or track your Windows programs and your PC performance.

 When you see the**Violation** message, your PC watchdog (aka bug checker) is overwhelmed. Probably because a DPC is running too long a time, or your system is stuck at an interrupt request level (IRQL) of DISPATCH\_LEVEL or above. [ \[1\] ](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Why would I have the _DPC Watchdog Violation_  error?

 In most cases, you will see this error when your device driver(s) is outdated or installed wrongly. For example, if you haven’t installed the video card driver for your new operating system,**DPC Watchdog Violation** could easily happen when you try to watch a video online.

 In some cases, incompatible hardware with your operating system can be the cause as well. For example, if your external hard driver is not longer supported by Windows 10, or that you have recently installed a new hardware device on your older computer, you will see**DPC Watchdog Violation** error as well.

 Sometimes, this error could be caused by software conflict, although not as common as the two causes above.

### Fix 1: Change SATA AHCI controller driver

 This is the most effective method according to a wide range of Windows users. So you might want to try it first:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and**X** at the same time, then click **Device Manager** .

### Fix 3: Check hardware and software compatibility

 As mentioned, incompatible hardware devices with your PC operating system, and/or conflicted software programs could be one of the causes of the DPC Watchdog Violation error as well.

#### Check hardware compatibility

 If you have some external devices plugged or installed on your PC, such as external hard drive or a USB flash drive, disconnect them all (leave your mouse and keyboard connected), then restart your computer.

 See if this error persists. If the error stops, plug your external devices back, only one at a time, then restart your PC. If you get the error again after certain device, you have got the culprit already. You can either replace this device completely from your PC, or update its driver as instructed in[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### Check software compatibility

 If this error only happens very recently, try to reflect if you have made some changes to your PC. For instance, have you installed a new application, or have you upgraded some programs.

 If you are not sure what changes you have done, you might want to do a[**system restore**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , to help you go back to the previous stage of your PC.

### Fix 4: Perform a disk check

 A blue screen of death error could indicate a disk problem. You may want to make sure that your disk is at a good state:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Enter** at the same time to**run Command Prompt as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cmd-1.png)  
 When prompted with the administrator permission, click**Yes** to continue.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cmd1.png)
2. On your keyboard, type **chkdsk /f /r** , then press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**IMPORTANT:** Disk check will start the next time you boot your PC and it might take some time to complete (could be a day for some). If, when you restart, you don’t have time to wait for the disk check to complete, you can skip it. You’ll need to reschedule it again, as described above, though.
