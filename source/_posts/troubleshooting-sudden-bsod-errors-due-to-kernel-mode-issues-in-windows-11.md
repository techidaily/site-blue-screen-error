![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mdsched-exe.png)

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .
