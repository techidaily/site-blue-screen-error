## 2.Run a virus scan

 The_**CRITICAL PROCESS DIED**_ error could be caused by some spyware or malware. Even if they aren’t the dangerous kind, they could still cause the problem.

 So before we go any deeper into solving this problem in other ways, you should scan your computer with a trusted antivirus program(s). If you find any malware-infectedprograms or files, uninstall and remove them completely.

## 3.Update device drivers

 In most cases, buggy drivers could cause_**Critical Process Died**_ blue screen of death error. You can try updating all the device drivers to the latest versions to fix it.

 There are two ways  you can get the right drivers for your video card and monitor: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update**  – You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for both all your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver for each. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows 10\.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact hardware devices, and your variant of Windows 10, and it will download and install them correctly .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Run SFC & DISM

 If your hard drive or RAM is corrupted, a blue screen of death error such as**Critical Process Died** would pop up and force reboot your computer. This is your computer’s way of protecting itself from further damage. You can run two built-in checks to make sure that your disk and RAM are at a good state:

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5.1: Run SFC (System File Checker)

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** at the same time to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following command and hit**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

 3) System File Checker will then scan all system files and repair any corrupted or missing ones it detected. This may take 3-5 minutes.

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620780&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/scan-now.jpg)

 4) After the scan, see if the Critical Process Died blue screen problem still persists. If so, move on to the next test.

### 5.2: Run dism.exe

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** at the same time. Type**cmd** and press**Ctrl+Shift+Enter** to run Command Prompt as administrator.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/cmd-1.jpg)

 Click**Yes** when prompted for permission to make changes to your device.

 2) In the Command Prompt window, copy and paste the following commands and hit**Enter** after each line:

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth

dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth

2) When the process finishes:

* If the DISM tool gives you errors, you can always try this command line. This will take up to 2 hours.

dism /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup

* If you get **Error: 0x800F081F** , reboot your computer, then open Command Prompt as administrator again (step 1) and run this command line instead:

Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore

 When these tests are done, see if the Critical Process Died problem remains. If the problem still persists, please move on to the next fix.

## 6: Update your BIOS or firmware

 If the above still doesn’t help to fix the Critical Process Died blue screen of death error on your computer, you may need to consider a BIOS and firmware update, as it could be a problem between your computer hardware and your Windows system. But you should always check your motherboard’s BIOS update release note to see if BSOD errors are mentioned.

 If you’re up for a BIOS update, here’s a post on how you can do it manually: **[ When & How to Safely Update BIOS \[Quick Guide\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**DO NOT** attempt a BIOS update if you’re not 100% confident in knowing what you’re doing, as a faulty BIOS update could harm or even brick your computer.

## 7: Check the crash logs

 If the Critical Process Died blue screen of death error still won’t go away, you can try to analyze the crash logs created by your computer when the blue screen happens: there are time stamps on the logs.

 If you’re interested in knowing more about analyzing your crash logs files, please refer to method 4 in this post we have: [**View Crash Logs with Minidump Files**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 You should then find some error codes and/or error messages in your minidump files that might help to locate the culprit to the Critical Process Died blue screen of death error on your computer. The codes or messages you see might be unique in your case, so we don’t have more general fixes here to suggest. But if you do find such codes or error messages, you can always search them on our knowledge base here: [**https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for further troubleshooting tips.
