## Driver Protection Oversight Rectified – No More Blue Screens of Death

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Snap4.png)

 Many Windows users see a**DRIVER PNP WATCHDOG** error when booting up Windows or running Windows Update, and usually Driver PNP Watchdog happens with a blue screen. The complete error message is: **You PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We’re just collecting some error info, and then we’ll restart for you. … Stop code: Driver PNP WATCHDOG.**

 If you’re one of them, don’t worry. This post puts together the workarounds to fix Driver PNP Watchdog.

## Try these fixes

 Here are the solutions to try. You shouldn’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working.

1. [Check SATA controller settings in BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run System File Checker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Perform a disk check](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Try Automatic Repair](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Check Volume Shadow Copy service](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Note: Performing these methods requires getting into Windows GUI. If you can’t log into Windows at all, you should boot into **[Safe Mode with Networking](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  at first, then perform these methods.

### Fix 1: Check SATA controller settings in BIOS

 When Driver PNP Watchdog error appears with a blue screen, it may relate to the BIOS settings. So you can check your BIOS settings in this way:

 1) Ensure your computer is**_OFF_** .

 2) Press the**Power** button to power on your computer, and keep pressing the**F2** key (or**DEL** key,**F1** ,**F3** , or**ESC** key depending on your computer brand) to enter BIOS.

 3) Use the**arrow keys** to select an option like**Advanced** or**Main** , then press**Enter** to access.

 4) Find an option like**Storage Configuration** ,**IDE Configuration** , or**Drive Configuration** . Then press the**Enter** key.

 5) Find an option like**Configure SATA** ,**SATA Mode** or**SATA Configuration** .

 6) Change that option to**IDE** ,**ATA** , or**Compatible** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-139.png)

7) Save and exit BIOS.

Now check if Driver PNP Watchdog has been resolved.

### Fix 2: Run System File Checker

 Basically the missing or corrupted system files may cause system errors or blue screen issues, so you can run System File Checker (SFC) to fix your problem by scanning and repairing any problematic files.

To do so, follow these steps:

 1) Type**cmd** in the search bar on your desktop, and right click**Command Prompt** (or**CMD** if you’re using Windows 7) and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-555.png)

 2) Copy and paste the following command into Command Prompt, and press**Enter** .

sfc /scannow

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-556.png)

3) Wait for the process to be 100% complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-559.png)

 4) Type**exit** in Command Prompt and press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-560.png)

5) Restart your computer.

 Now run Windows Update and see the Driver PNP Watchdog error has been resolved.

 If the steps to troubleshoot the Driver PNP Watchdog error have not resolved the issue, you may need more advanced diagnostics and repair capabilities beyond what the System File Checker provides. An option to consider is the Windows repair software **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Fortect goes deeper than System File Checker to scan critical system components and can automatically fix a wider range of issues.

Some specific situations where Fortect could help include:

* Corrupted or damaged driver files causing system instability;
* Inaccurate or damaged Windows registry preventing proper driver operation;
* Problems with key Windows services like the Volume Shadow Copy Service;
* Damaged system files beyond what System File Checker can repair.

To utilize Fortect, all you have to do is:

 1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect. It will run a free scan of your PC and give you **a detailed report of your PC status** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-scan.jpg)

 3) Once finished, you’ll see a report showing all the issues. To fix all the issues automatically, click **Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).

### Fix 3: Perform a disk check

 CHKDSK is a Windows tool that checks the file system metadata of a volume for errors. So if you see the Driver PNP Watchdog error in your computer, running the CHKDSK tool may help scan that issue and fix it.

Here’s how to do it:

 1) Type**cmd** in the search box on your desktop, right-click**Command Prompt** (or**CMD** if you’re using Windows 7), and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-555.png)

 2) Click**Yes** to accept UAC if prompted.

 3) Type (or copy and paste) the following command in Command Prompt. Then press**Enter** on your keyboard.

chkdsk.exe /f /r

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-142.png)

 3) Type**Y** in the Command Prompt to confirm that you’d like to perform the disk check next time you restart your computer. Then press**Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-141.png)

 4) Make sure you’ve closed all the applications and saved your work. Then restart Windows.

 5) Disk check will start after restarting your computer. It might take some time to complete (could be a day for some).

**Note** : If you don’t have time to wait for the disk check when restarting, you can skip it. If you want to reschedule the disk check again, perform the steps above to reschedule.

 6) Once the disk check has been completed, check your computer or run Windows Update again to see if the Driver PNP Watchdog error has been removed.

 If so, then congrats. If not, don’t worry. There are other solutions.
