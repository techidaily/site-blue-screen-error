## **2\. Rum Memory Diagnose and Disk Check**

 7) When the memory check finishes, your PC will start checking your disks. It’ll take some time to finish.

 8) If memory check and disk check report problems with your RAM or hard drive, you might need to get your RAM or hard drives replaced.

## **3\. Update device drivers**

 The installation of a fault driver could also be the cause of  0x00000050 blue screen error. To fix it, you need to update all your device drivers to their best-match versions.
