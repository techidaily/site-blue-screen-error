### Fix 1: Update your device drivers

 Your outdated/corrupted drivers are the most common reason behind this **0x00000019 blue screen of death** issue.  It can be difficult to put finger on which one is offending our system so we need to update **ALL** the drivers available to help resolve the situation.

 There’re two ways you can update your device drivers — manually or automatically:

**Update your drivers manually** –  To troubleshoot the issue, you can update all available drivers manually **ONE BY ONE**   until you pin down the exact driver at fault. Firstly you’ll have to go to  the manufacturer’s website, search for the most recent correct driver for the devices. Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows system versions. Then download & update them on your own.

**OR**

**Update your drivers automatically** – Manually updating all the drivers is no picnic. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either[**the FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 You can also click **Update** to do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer and keep track of your PC to see if the blue screen and crashing problem gets fixed.

### Fix 2: Disable Fast Startup

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **powercfg.cpl**   into the box and click **OK** .

### Fix 3: Disable Windows search

### Fix 4: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

 If you’ve recently made any changes to your computer, say upgrading memory etc., then we might have to run the built-in Windows tool called**Windows Memory Diagnostic** to help check  our system for memory problems and see if it fixes this **0x00000019** blue screen problem.

 The whole memory test will take 20 minutes or even longer. Be sure to**have enough time set aside** before you run**Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press    **the Windows logo key ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)**  and type memory. Then click on**Windows Memory Diagnostic** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b99e83b8a93a.jpg)
2. Be sure to**save your work** &**close all apps** on your PC before clicking **Restart now and check for problems (Recommended)** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b99e87a6d482.jpg)
3. Wait until Windows restarts again(that’s when the memory test finishes), and then:

* **If you get a report of memory errors** , then follow the on-screen instructions to further troubleshoot.
* **If you get a No memory errors were detected from Windows Memory Diagnostic** , then you don’t have failing/failed memory on your RAM. You might have to move to**Fix 5** to get this **0x00000019** (**Bad\_Pool\_Header** ) fixed.

### Fix 5: Check for hardware issues

 Turn off and unplug your PC, then remove all of your RAM sticks. Try to power your computer back on with the sticks, ONE BY ONE. If your computer fails to boot with one specific RAM, you know which one is to blame.
