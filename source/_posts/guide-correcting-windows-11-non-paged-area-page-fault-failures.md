## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .
