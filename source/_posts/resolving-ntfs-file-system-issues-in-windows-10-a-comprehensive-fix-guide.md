### Fix 2: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

 If you’ve recently made any changes to your computer, say upgrading memory etc., then we might have to run the built-in Windows tool called **Windows Memory Diagnostic**   to help check  our system for memory problems and see if it fixes this **Bad Pool Header** blue screen problem.

 The whole memory test will take 20 minutes or even longer. Be sure to **have enough time set aside** before you run **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and type memory. Then click on **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

1. FOn your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**  into the box and press **Enter** .

4. Click **Apply**   \> **OK** .
5. Restart your computer and check if the **Bad\_Pool\_Header**  issue is fixed. If yes, then great! If it still persists, please move on to**Fix 4** , below.
