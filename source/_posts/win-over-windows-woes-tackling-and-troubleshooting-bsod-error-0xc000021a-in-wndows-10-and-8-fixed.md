### Solution 1: Update all your available driver to the latest version

So you can update all the available driver on your computer to fix this issue, typically the**video driver** and**network driver** according many users’ report.

3. Click**Restart now and check for problems** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0065d2532.jpg)

 Windows should then automatically check for memory problems once your computer restarts.

 As soon as Windows completes the process, your computer will restart again. Check if the blue screen error disappears.
