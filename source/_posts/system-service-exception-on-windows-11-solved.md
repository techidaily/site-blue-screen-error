## Fix 2: Update the graphics driver

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration4.png)
6. Click **Restart** to restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration5.png)

**Restart** your PC to check whether the problem reappears. If not, you need to open the **System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications **one by one** until you find the problematic software. After enabling each services, you need to restart your PC to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic software that triggers the BSOD error, you need to **uninstall** it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.

## Fix 5: Run memory diagnostic tool

 As mentioned, one of the possible causes for this problem is faulty hardware, such as corrupted memory card. Luckily, you can easily get it checked out with the built-in diagnostic tool. Here is how:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog. Type**mdsched.exe** and press**Enter** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://modlily.sjv.io/c/5597632/2072819/17059" target="_top" id="2072819"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17059-2072819" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2072819/17059" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-37-58.png)
2. You could choose **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or choose **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-39-29-1.png)
3. You will see this page showing the progress of the check and number of passes it will run on memory.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-40-21-1.png)  
 If you don’t see any error, your memory card is not causing any issues.
4. If you have installed some hardware diagnostics tools that you can trust provided by the manufacturers, run them on your computer as well to see if they are able to tell you what is causing this problem.

## Fix 6: Check the Event Viewer

 Event Viewer tells you exactly what happened when you had the Critical\_Structure\_Corruption blue screen of death error. You’ll have a better idea what is the culprit driver or hardware when the error occurs. Here is how you can check it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then click **Event Viewer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-42-28.png)
2. On the left side of the pane, click **Windows Logs**  and **System** . Check the mid section for any suspicious event that happens just about the time when the blue screen error occurs. See if certain program is the culprit for your problem.
