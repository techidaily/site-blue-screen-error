3. Click**Restart now and check for problems** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0065d2532.jpg)

 Windows should then automatically check for memory problems once your computer restarts.

 As soon as Windows completes the process, your computer will restart again. Check if the blue screen error disappears.
