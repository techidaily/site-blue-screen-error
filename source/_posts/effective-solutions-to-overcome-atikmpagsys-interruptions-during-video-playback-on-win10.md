1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **R**   at the same time, then copy & paste **msinfo32**  into the box and press **Enter** .

3. Check out the **Support** (or **Download** ) section and search for the latest BIOS update.
4. Download the file and install it properly.
5. Restart your PC and see if the CLASSPNP.SYS blue screen problem has been resolved. If yes, then great. But if it doesn’t work, don’t worry. There’s one more step for you to try.
