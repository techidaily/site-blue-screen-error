### Fix 2: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

 If you’ve recently made any changes to your computer, say upgrading memory etc., then we might have to run the built-in Windows tool called **Windows Memory Diagnostic**   to help check  our system for memory problems and see if it fixes this **Bad Pool Header** blue screen problem.

 The whole memory test will take 20 minutes or even longer. Be sure to **have enough time set aside** before you run **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and type memory. Then click on **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

### Fix 3: Disable Windows search

**Windows search** is a service in our system that keeps an index of files on your computer to improve searching speed. But it can also be corrupted and responsible for this blue screen issue. So we might have to disable it to see if it works. Here’s how:

1. FOn your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**  into the box and press **Enter** .

### Fix 5: Check disk errors

 Disk check is a useful in-built  Windows tool that scans our hard disk and external drives for errors and fix them.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time. Then right-click on**Local Disk (C:)** and click**Properties** .
