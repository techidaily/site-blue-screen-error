## Try these fixes

 Here are the solutions to try. You shouldn’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working.

1. [Check SATA controller settings in BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run System File Checker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Perform a disk check](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
