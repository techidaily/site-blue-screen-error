## Fix 1: Uninstall potential problematic software

**Alcohol 120%** , **Daemon Tools** , **MacDriver** and **Intel HAXM** (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) are reported to be related to the Critical\_Structure\_Corruption blue screen of death error. If you have one of them installed in your PC, upgrade them to the latest version or remove them from your PC. See if your problem is resolved after this.

## Fix 2: Update the graphics driver

 In many cases, this blue screen of death error is caused by faulty video card driver. There are two ways for you to get the right driver for your video card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-40-21-1.png)  
 If you don’t see any error, your memory card is not causing any issues.
4. If you have installed some hardware diagnostics tools that you can trust provided by the manufacturers, run them on your computer as well to see if they are able to tell you what is causing this problem.

## Fix 6: Check the Event Viewer

 Event Viewer tells you exactly what happened when you had the Critical\_Structure\_Corruption blue screen of death error. You’ll have a better idea what is the culprit driver or hardware when the error occurs. Here is how you can check it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then click **Event Viewer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-42-28.png)
2. On the left side of the pane, click **Windows Logs**  and **System** . Check the mid section for any suspicious event that happens just about the time when the blue screen error occurs. See if certain program is the culprit for your problem.
