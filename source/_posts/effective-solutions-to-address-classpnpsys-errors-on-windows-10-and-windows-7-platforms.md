 If you’ve recently made any changes to your computer, say upgrading memory etc., then we might have to run the built-in Windows tool called **Windows Memory Diagnostic**   to help check  our system for memory problems and see if it fixes this **Bad Pool Header** blue screen problem.

 The whole memory test will take 20 minutes or even longer. Be sure to **have enough time set aside** before you run **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and type memory. Then click on **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .
