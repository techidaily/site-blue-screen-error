## Fix 1: Uninstall potential problematic software

**Alcohol 120%** , **Daemon Tools** , **MacDriver** and **Intel HAXM** (Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager) are reported to be related to the Critical\_Structure\_Corruption blue screen of death error. If you have one of them installed in your PC, upgrade them to the latest version or remove them from your PC. See if your problem is resolved after this.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-40-21-1.png)  
 If you don’t see any error, your memory card is not causing any issues.

4. If you have installed some hardware diagnostics tools that you can trust provided by the manufacturers, run them on your computer as well to see if they are able to tell you what is causing this problem.

## Fix 6: Check the Event Viewer

 Event Viewer tells you exactly what happened when you had the Critical\_Structure\_Corruption blue screen of death error. You’ll have a better idea what is the culprit driver or hardware when the error occurs. Here is how you can check it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then click **Event Viewer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-42-28.png)
2. On the left side of the pane, click **Windows Logs**  and **System** . Check the mid section for any suspicious event that happens just about the time when the blue screen error occurs. See if certain program is the culprit for your problem.
