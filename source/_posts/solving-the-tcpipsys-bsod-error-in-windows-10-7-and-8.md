**IMPORTANT** : You’ll need to be logged into Windows on the problem computer to try any of these solutions.  When the blue screen issue appears, restart your PC.

 **Solution 1: Update video card drivers**

 Outdated corrupted video card drivers can be the main cause, so make sure you have the latest driver for your video card. You can update the video card drivers manually, but if you don’t have time, patience or computer skills, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

## **Solution 3: Keep computer and video card adequately cool**

 Overheating can cause your video card’s chipset to lock up. In that case, Thread Stuck in Device Driver error would occur. So make sure your PC and your video card are adequately cooled.

 When you get this error, check to see if the computer is overheating. If it’s overheating, turn of the computer and turn it on later until the computer cools down (about 30 minutes). If you’d like to troubleshoot what’s causing computer overheating, you can refer to[6 Top Tips to Cool Down an Overheating Laptop](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## **Solution 4:**

**Upgrade the power supply**

 If you’are sing a desktop PC, try upgrading your computer’s power supply. If the power supply is in poor quality, it will be unable to provide adequate power to all your computer’s components. In this case, it may result in a “brown out” of sorts in your system. Remove the old power supply and replace it with a more appropriate one. If you’re not sure how to do this, go to the near computer repair shop to have a further check.
