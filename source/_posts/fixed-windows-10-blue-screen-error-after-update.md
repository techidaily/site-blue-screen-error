![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/img_598bc7d9d8c1c.jpg)

A**Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**is usually hardware or software related. In most cases, when you see a blue screen of death error, you will also see an error code (marked by the red rectangle). Since the exact cause and the solutions could be hard to get, Microsoft has included a QR code with each BSOD in Windows 10\. If you missed the chance to mark down the error code or scan the QR code, you are not at your wits ends. There are still many options that you can try to get the blue screen of death error go away. **Note that** methods varied depending on different codes. If you want to have more specific tutorial about a specific BSOD error, search your error code in our knowledge base [_https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/_](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). If your problem has yet to be addresses, feel free to leave us comment and we’ll see what else we can do. Step 1:[**Check if you have enough space left**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)Step 2: **[Scan your computer for viruses](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** Step 3: **[Apply all available Windows service packs and other updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** Step 4: **[Test Your System Memory and your Hard Disk Drive(HDD)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/5-tips-to-fix-a-blue-screen-of-death-bsod-on-windows-10/#m4)** Step 5: **[Roll Back Drivers in Safe Mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** **IMPORTANT**: If your computer won’t boot, you need to refer to[**this post**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)to get into desktop and then safe mode first.

## 1: Check if you have enough space left

Blue Screen of Death problems and some other serious error, such as data corruption, can occur if there is not enough free space on your primary partition used for Windows operating system, which is usually installed in Disk or partition C. Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space, please make sure that you have enough room in your Disk C to store the setup files of Windows 10\.

## 2: Scan your computer for viruses

Make sure you have upgraded your antivirus program database to the latest version first. Then use it to scan your computer to see if there is some virus that could cause this problem. If you are not sure how to update your database of your antivirus program, it is suggested that you search for related information in the developer or manufacturer website.

## 3: Apply all available Windows service packs and other updates

Service pack is a collection of updates and fixes, called patches, for operating system or a software program. It usually allows an easy and single installation. You could usually check your service pack in**Control Panel > System**. In Windows, most patches and fixes are available through**Windows Update**. It is suggested that you check whether your computer has installed the latest released patches in**Settings > Updates & security.** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/settings-updates-security.jpg)It’s also important that you keep your device drivers up-to-date. Some BSOD could be caused by faulty or outdated device drivers. To update your drivers, you can search on the manufacturer support website your PC model and see if there are updates available. If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).

## ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/problem-free.png)  5: Roll Back Drivers in Safe Mode

One of the first things you need to ask yourself is whether you have installed any new applications or drivers on your computer. If so, it is very likely that the change you made caused the BSOD. In this case, it is suggested that you**roll the newly installed driver back**to its previous version. If you are not sure what changes have you made, it is suggested that you do a system restore. If you need help with system restore on Windows 10, please refer to[**this post here**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)for more information. 1) Go to**Safe Mode**first. For more information as to how to get to Safe Mode, please refer to[**this post here**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). 2) On your keyboard, press**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816bda07f0c7.png)and**R**at the same time. Then type**devmgmt.msc**in the run box and hit**Enter**.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/devmgmt-msc.png)3) In**Device Manager**, locate the device that you would like to roll back the driver to. Right-click the device name and click **Properties**. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816bdbabd864.jpg)4) Go to the **Driver**tab, and click **Roll Back Driver**.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/roll-back-driver.jpg)5) If the**Roll Back Driver**option here is**grey**, you will not be able to use this function.
