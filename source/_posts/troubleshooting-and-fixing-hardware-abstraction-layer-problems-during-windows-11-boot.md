## **First Thing First**

 1) You’ve installed all available updates and packs on**Windows Update** . You can check by following the path:**Start button > Settings > Updates & security** .

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 Faulty RAM is a very common reason for a blue screen of death problem such as Bad Pool Caller. You can run the built-in check to see if your RAM is at fault:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mdsched-exe.png)

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/restart-now-and-check-for-problems-recommended.jpg)

 3) When you restart your PC, the check will start as well. It’ll take up to 10 minutes to finish.

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .
