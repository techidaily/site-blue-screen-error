## Fix 6: Check the Event Viewer

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **X** at the same time, then click **Event Viewer** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/2019-09-16_16-42-28.png)
2. On the left side of the pane, click **Windows Logs**  and **System** . Check the mid section for any suspicious event that happens just about the time when the blue screen error occurs. See if certain program is the culprit for your problem.
