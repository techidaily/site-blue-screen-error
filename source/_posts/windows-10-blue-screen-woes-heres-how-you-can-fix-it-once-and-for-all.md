**Note** : You need to logon to your PC desktop to try the fixes below. If you’re having trouble logging in, feel free to leave us comments and we’ll see what we can do to help.

## **1\. Undo recent changes**

 Faulty hardware or fail to install hardware right is closely related to the blue screen of death error 0x00000050\.

 If this is the very first time you had such a problem, and you’ve recently added certain hardware or installed some programs to your computer, they might be the culprit. You may need to remove or uninstall them completely from your PC.

 Check if your existing hardware has failed. If you find any not working hardware, remove them as well or replace them with well-functioned ones.

## **2\. Rum Memory Diagnose and Disk Check**

 If your RAM or hard drive is defective, your PC will shut down to protect you from further damage. You can run a memory check and a disk check to see if you need to replace them with new ones:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59ad1f04d88bb.png) and type in**cmd** . Right-click**cmd** and click**Run as administrator** .
