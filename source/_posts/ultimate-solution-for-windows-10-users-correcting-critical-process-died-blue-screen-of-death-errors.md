To do so, follow these steps:

 1) Type**cmd** in the search bar on your desktop, and right click**Command Prompt** (or**CMD** if you’re using Windows 7) and select**Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-555.png)

 2) Copy and paste the following command into Command Prompt, and press**Enter** .

sfc /scannow
