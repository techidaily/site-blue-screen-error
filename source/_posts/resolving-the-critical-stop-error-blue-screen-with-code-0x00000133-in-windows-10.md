 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**
