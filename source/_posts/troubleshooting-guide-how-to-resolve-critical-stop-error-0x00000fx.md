## Method 1: Update all your available drivers

 Updating drivers should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your computer or system. Whether you choose to update the device drivers manually, using Windows Update, or you use a trusted third party product, it’s essential that you have the latest correct device drivers for your operating system at all times.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

 To update your drivers with Driver Easy, just click the **Scan Now**   button, then when it lists the drivers you need to update, click **Update** . The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with [**Driver Easy Pro**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Restart your computer to see if the blue screen disappear. If it shows again, you know your drivers weren’t to blame, and you should try the next fix.

##  Method 2: Uninstall your antivirus software temporarily

 This problem could also be caused by your antivirus software. Try to uninstall your antivirus software, then restart your computer to see if the blue screen is gone.

**Important:**  Please reinstall your antivirus software whether Method 2 helps you fix this problem. It’s important to keep an antivirus software to protect your computer.
