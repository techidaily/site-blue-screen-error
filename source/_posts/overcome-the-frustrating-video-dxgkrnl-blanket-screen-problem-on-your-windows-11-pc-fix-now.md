 Most of the time, the UNEXPECTED\_KERNEL\_MODE\_TRAP error is caused by incompatible, faulty or outdated drivers. So you should update your available device drivers to see if it fixes your problem.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and (if you go Pro) installs any driver updates your computer needs.

The correct drivers will be downloaded, and you can install them – either manually through Windows or all automatically with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .
