<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/restart-now-and-check-for-problems-recommended.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/windows-memory-diagnostics-tool.jpg)

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 Apart from fault RAM, corrupted hard drive is another most likely reason of a blue screen of death. To see if your hard drive is the culprit:

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/start-button-file-explorer-this-pc.jpg)

 2) Right-click the hard driver you want to check and click **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/img_59aa664b972ec.png)

 3) Go to**Tools** tab and click**Check** .

 4) If your hard disk drive is problem free, you will see the notification like this:

## **Other options**

 If none of the above options help, see if the experience from our users are able solve the problem for you.

 1)**Update BIOS** . If updating device drivers and Windows patches won’t help, you need to update your BIOS. Please be sure that you are fully aware of what you are doing when updating the BIOS. Any possible losses are at your own peril.

 3)**Uninstall third-party antivirus programs.**  Antivirus apps apart from Windows Defender could be incompatible with your system settings. You should disable them to see if the problem is gone. You should never disable Windows Defender.
