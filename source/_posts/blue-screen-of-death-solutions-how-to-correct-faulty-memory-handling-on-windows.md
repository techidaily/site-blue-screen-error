### Fix 2: Run Windows Memory Diagnostic

 If you’ve recently made any changes to your computer, say upgrading memory etc., then we might have to run the built-in Windows tool called **Windows Memory Diagnostic**   to help check  our system for memory problems and see if it fixes this **Bad Pool Header** blue screen problem.

 The whole memory test will take 20 minutes or even longer. Be sure to **have enough time set aside** before you run **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and type memory. Then click on **Windows Memory Diagnostic** .

2. Be sure to **save your work**   & **close all apps**   on your PC before clicking **Restart now and check for problems (Recommended)** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b9a0ea7a77ce.jpg)
3. Wait until Windows restarts again(that’s when the memory test finishes), and then:

* **If you get a report of memory errors** , then follow the on-screen instructions to further troubleshoot.
* **If you get a No memory errors were detected from Windows Memory Diagnostic** , then you don’t have failed memory on your RAM, please move on to**Fix 3** below to further troubleshoot.

### Fix 3: Disable Windows search

**Windows search** is a service in our system that keeps an index of files on your computer to improve searching speed. But it can also be corrupted and responsible for this blue screen issue. So we might have to disable it to see if it works. Here’s how:

1. FOn your keyboard, press the   **Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time. Then copy & paste **services.msc**  into the box and press **Enter** .

### Fix 4: Check for hardware issues

 Turn off and unplug your PC, then remove all of your RAM sticks. Try to power your computer back on with the sticks, ONE BY ONE. If your computer fails to boot with one specific RAM, you know which one is to blame.

### Fix 5: Check disk errors

 Disk check is a useful in-built  Windows tool that scans our hard disk and external drives for errors and fix them.

To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time. Then right-click on**Local Disk (C:)** and click**Properties** .
