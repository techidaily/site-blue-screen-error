## **First Thing First**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Step 1** **: Undo recent Changes**

 One of the causes of this blue screen error could be recent changes you’ve made to your system. If you’ve added new hardware or software to your system recently, remove them to see if the problem is fixed.

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

## **Step 2: Update Available Device Drivers**

 Another possible causes of this problem is faulty or outdated device drivers, such as the drivers for your sound card, graphics card, chipset, network adapters, processors and many more.

 You should verify that all your devices have the latest driver, and update those that don’t.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/img_58ee046d95f1d.png)

 3) Click the**Update** button next to any flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_**Update All**_ ).

## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 Faulty RAM is a very common reason for a blue screen of death problem such as Bad Pool Caller. You can run the built-in check to see if your RAM is at fault:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/restart-now-and-check-for-problems-recommended.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.

 1) Follow the path**Start button** **\> File Explorer > This PC** .
