 Sometimes, there might be incompatibility problem between your system and certain hardware. You might want to remove such hardware to stop this problem from happening again.
  
 4) A refresh or reset on your Windows 10 is your last resort. For more information as to how to reset your Windows 10, please refer to[**this post here**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
