## **Other Work-arounds**

 1) Undo whatever changes you recently made to your system. For example, if you’ve recently added certain hardware to your PC, remove it. If you’ve installed some programs, uninstall them or get them upgraded to the latest versions available.
  
 3) If none of the above methods work, you might want to check your hardware to see if it’s the culprit. Check to see if your graphics card is at a good state. If it’s broken, get a new one.

 Sometimes, there might be incompatibility problem between your system and certain hardware. You might want to remove such hardware to stop this problem from happening again.
  
 4) A refresh or reset on your Windows 10 is your last resort. For more information as to how to reset your Windows 10, please refer to[**this post here**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
