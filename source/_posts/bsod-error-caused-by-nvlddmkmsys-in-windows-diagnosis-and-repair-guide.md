### Solution 1: Update all your available driver to the latest version

**0x000000D1** translates to**DRIVER\_IRQL\_NOT\_LESS\_OR\_EQUAL** , which means that a driver on your system has failed to access the memory. So you can update all the available driver on your computer to fix this issue, typically the**video driver** and**network driver** according many users’ report.

 You can update your drivers through Device Manager to let Windows detect and install the update. But you need to verify all your drivers one by one manually.. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro version** of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just**2 clicks** (and you get**full support** and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note:** You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8cffe964db3.jpg)

 Restart your computer to see if the error disappear. If yes, so great! If you still see the error, don’t give up hope, you have something else to try…

### Solution 2: Check for memory problems

**A bad memory module** may also cause this problem. You can run the built-in Memory Diagnostics tool to check if your computer has memory problems.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and press**R** to bring up the Run box.
2. Type**mdsched.exe** and press**Enter** to run the tool.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d00474dff3.jpg)
3. Click**Restart now and check for problems** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b8d0065d2532.jpg)

 Windows should then automatically check for memory problems once your computer restarts.

 As soon as Windows completes the process, your computer will restart again. Check if the blue screen error disappears.
