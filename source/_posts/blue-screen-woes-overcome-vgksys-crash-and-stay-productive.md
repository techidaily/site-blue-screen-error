The complete error message is: **You PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We’re just collecting some error info, and then we’ll restart for you. … Stop code: Driver PNP WATCHDOG.**

 If you’re one of them, don’t worry. This post puts together the workarounds to fix Driver PNP Watchdog.

## Try these fixes

 Here are the solutions to try. You shouldn’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everything’s working.

1. [Check SATA controller settings in BIOS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Run System File Checker](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Perform a disk check](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Try Automatic Repair](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
