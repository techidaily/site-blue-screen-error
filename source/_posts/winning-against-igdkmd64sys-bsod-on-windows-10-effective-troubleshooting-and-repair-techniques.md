 4) Reboot your Windows 10 into normal mode. See if the Blue screen has gone.

## **Solution 3\. Update your drivers**

 The blue screen errors are always caused by the incompatible, outdated or corrupted drivers. Therefore, we highly recommend updating device drivers on your Windows to ensure your system run properly whenever the blue screen shows on your computer.

 There are two ways you can update your device drivers: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your devices, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your variant of Windows versions. In this way, y ou will need to check the update for your devices one by one.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find all the available correct drivers, and it will download and install them correctly :

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers
