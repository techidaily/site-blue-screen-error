### Fix 2: Roll back your network driver

 2) Double-click on**Network adapters** and then double-click on**your network adapter** /**Wi-Fi adapter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b59b231e2ea5.jpg)

 3) Click the**Driver** tab >**Roll Back Driver** \>**OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b59b2e77df85.jpg)

 If the**Roll Back Driver** button is grayed out, then move on to[**Fix 3**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 4) Click**Yes** once asked to confirm the driver rollback.

 5) Repeat the driver rollback procedure if you have both **network adapter** and**Wi-Fi** drivers.

 6) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
