## **First Thing First**

 If you have done the above two things, and the problem persists, please move forward to find the solution for you.

## **Step 1** **: Undo recent Changes**

 One of the causes of this blue screen error could be recent changes you’ve made to your system. If you’ve added new hardware or software to your system recently, remove them to see if the problem is fixed.

If the problem persists, move on to the next step.

## **Step 2: Update Available Device Drivers**

 Another possible causes of this problem is faulty or outdated device drivers, such as the drivers for your sound card, graphics card, chipset, network adapters, processors and many more.

 You should verify that all your devices have the latest driver, and update those that don’t.

## **Step 3:** **Run a Memory Check**

 Faulty RAM is a very common reason for a blue screen of death problem such as Bad Pool Caller. You can run the built-in check to see if your RAM is at fault:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/img_5816b9195578f.png) and **R** at the same time to invoke a **Run** command. Type **mdsched.exe** in the run box and press **Enter** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/mdsched-exe.png)

 2) You could click **Restart now and check for problems (recommended)** to check the status of your memory card right now, or click **Check for problems the next time I start my computer** if you are too occupied now.

 4) If you don’t see any error here, it’s likely that your memory card is not causing any issues. Move on to next step.

## **Step 4:** **Check for Hard Drive Corruption**

**\*** Please make sure you have closed all open programs and files before your disk check.
